Challenge: Explore real-world flight data
As a data scientist, a significant part of the role is to explore, analyze, and visualize data. In this challenge,We will explore a real-world dataset that contains flight data from the US Department of Transportation.

# Load the required packages
suppressPackageStartupMessages({
  library(tidyverse)
  library(summarytools)
  library(glue)
  library(patchwork)
  })

# Initialize github repo path 
# containing test files used to check your answers
testsFolderPath <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-machine-learning-with-r/main/tests/explore-analyze-data-with-r/"

Now, We import the data into R and start doing some data science on it!
# Load and view the data
df_flights <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MicrosoftDocs/ml-basics/master/challenges/data/flights.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)

df_flights %>%
  slice_head(n = 7)
  
  
  The dataset contains observations of US domestic flights in 2013, and consists of the following fields:

Year: The year of the flight (all records are from 2013)
Month: The month of the flight
DayofMonth: The day of the month on which the flight departed
DayOfWeek: The day of the week on which the flight departed, from 1 (Monday) to 7 (Sunday)
Carrier: The two-letter abbreviation for the airline
OriginAirportID: A unique numeric identifier for the departure aiport
OriginAirportName: The full name of the departure airport
OriginCity: The departure airport city
OriginState: The departure airport state
DestAirportID: A unique numeric identifier for the destination aiport
DestAirportName: The full name of the destination airport
DestCity: The destination airport city
DestState: The destination airport state
CRSDepTime: The scheduled departure time
DepDelay: The number of minutes the departure was delayed (flights that left ahead of schedule have a negative value)
DelDelay15: A binary indicator that the departure was delayed by more than 15 minutes (and is therefore considered "late")
CRSArrTime: The scheduled arrival time
ArrDelay: The number of minutes the arrival was delayed (flights that arrived ahead of schedule have a negative value)
ArrDelay15: A binary indicator that the arrival was delayed by more than 15 minutes (and is therefore considered "late")
Cancelled: A binary indicator that the flight was canceled
Your challenge is to explore the flight data to analyze factors that might cause delays in a flight's departure or arrival.

Start by cleaning the data.

Identify any null or missing data, and impute appropriate replacement values.

Identify and eliminate any outliers in the DepDelay and ArrDelay columns.

Explore the cleaned data.

View summary statistics for the numeric fields in the dataset.
Determine the distribution of the DepDelay and ArrDelay columns.
Use statistics, aggregate functions, and visualizations to answer the following questions:

What are the average (mean) departure and arrival delays?
How do the carriers compare in terms of arrival delay performance?
Is there a noticeable difference in arrival delays for different days of the week?
Which departure airport has the highest average departure delay?
Do late departures tend to result in longer arrival delays than on-time departures?
Which route (from departure airport to destination airport) has the most late arrivals?
Which route has the highest average arrival delay?
Sometimes, when there are a lot of columns in the data, it can be difficult at first to get a good grasp of it by using slice_head.

By using glimpse, we can view a transposed version of the data frame, where columns are displayed vertically and the data is displayed horizontally. This makes it possible to easily view every column in a data frame. At the same time, glimpse shows the dimension of the data frame and underlying data types of the columns.
